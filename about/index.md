## Our Mission
Accelerating and disseminate open innovation to improve foundational capabilities, safety, security and trust in artificial intelligence, and to responsibly maximize benefits to people and society everywhere. The AI Alliance brings together a critical mass of compute, data, tools, and talent to accelerate open innovation in AI. The AI Alliance Japan Chapter is an initiative to support AI sovereignty and industrial AI in Japan.

### Sovereign AI
We will drive the open development of sovereign AI capabilities that address Japan-specific cultural and economic context with particular focus on AI agents, data, models and evaluation

### Industrial AI
We will collaborate to advance open-source AI research and development for industrial applications such as manufacturing, semiconductors, shipping and navigation, where reliable, accurate, domain-enriched AI systems are essential to success
